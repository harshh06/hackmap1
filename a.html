            <h2>WEB-DEVELOPMENT</h2>
        <br><br>
        
            <p >
                    Web development broadly refers to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development, client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks.

                    Web development is also known as website development.

                    Web development is the coding or programming that enables website functionality, per the owner's requirements. It mainly deals with the non-design aspect of building websites, which includes coding and writing markup.

                    Web development ranges from creating plain text pages to complex web-based applications, social network applications and electronic business applications. <br>

                    There are two broad divisions of web development – front-end development (also called client-side development) and back-end development (also called server-side development). <br>

                    Front-end development refers to constructing what a user sees when they load a web application – the content, design and how you interact with it. This is done with three codes – HTML, CSS and JavaScript. <br>

                    Back-end development controls what goes on behind the scenes of a web application. A back-end often uses a database to generate the front-end.

                    Back-end scripts are written in many different coding languages and frameworks, such as… <br>

                    PHP , 
                    Ruby on Rails, 
                    ASP.NET, 
                    Perl , 
                    Java , 
                    Node.js , 
                    Python .

                Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.

                The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing the site. They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.

            <br>
            <p>
                The backend (or “server-side”) is the portion of the website you don’t see. It’s responsible for storing and organizing data, and ensuring everything on the client-side actually works. The backend communicates with the front-end, sending and receiving information to be displayed as a web page. Whenever you fill out a contact form, type in a web address, or make a purchase (any user interaction on the client-side), your browser sends a request to the server-side, which returns information in the form of frontend code that the browser can interpret and display.
                Your new site will need to have additional backend components to make it a dynamic web application — a website whose content can change based on what is in its database , and that can be modified by user input. This is distinct from a static website, which doesn’t require a database because its content generally stays the same.

        <h2>Full-Stack Development</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            A full stack developer has the functional knowledge and the ability to work on all aspects involved in building an application. He is proficient in
•	Writing optimized front-end code in HTML, Java, JavaScript
•	Creating and using APIs and writing backend code in Ruby, Python/Java
•	Working with system infrastructure including hardware and OS
•	Networking, Security
•	Understanding, creating and querying databases
•	Project management and Client coordination
Hence a full stack developer can develop strategies for every part of the web development process. He develops this deep knowledge of the systems through years of experience in working in this field. So a full stack developer is nothing less than a veteran who has high responsibilities. Such skills are difficult to gather and people who possess these skills are greatly in-demand in the industry.
